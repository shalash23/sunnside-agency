## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Creating a reponsive menu design was the main challenge I didn't anticipate. The overflowing was hell to deal with.

### Continued development

More into responsive design and media queries

### Useful resources

- [overflow-x](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14270084/overflow-xhidden-doesnt-prevent-content-from-overflowing-in-mobile-browsers) - This helped me in removing the overflow issues with responsive nav-bar
- [Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - This is an amazing calculator to calculate the clamp values for responsive typography which is always a pain
